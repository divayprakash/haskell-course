# Week 8 Programming Assignment

In this assignment you have to submit a standalone Haskell program that can be compiled using the `ghc` compiler.  Your program should read some lines of text and print them out in reverse order, with each line individually reversed.  The input will end with a line containing the letters `"EOF"`.

**Sample Test Cases**

Test Case | Input	| Output
--------- | ----- | ------
Test Case 1	| Line 1<br>Line 2<br>EOF | 2 eniL<br>1 eniL
