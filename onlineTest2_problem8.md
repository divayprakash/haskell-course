# Online Test 2, Problem 8

Write a Haskell function `repeated :: [String] -> Int` that takes a list of strings and returns the number of values that are repeated in the input list.

**Sample Test Cases**

Test Case | Input	| Output
--------- | ----- | ------
Test Case 1	| `repeated ["the","higher","you","climb","the","further","you","fall"]` | `2`
